                He went from distributing newspapers after school during
                childhood to become the President of our country. He was awarded
                Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and Bharat Ratna – the highest
                civilian honour. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam made every day of his

                Former President of India and reputed scientist Dr. A.P.J. Abdul
                Kalam passed away on Monday evening at a hospital in Meghalaya.
                Reports say he collapsed while delivering a lecture at Indian
                Institute of Management in Shillong and was admitted in the
                hospital in a very critical condition.

                The 11th president of our country was 83 when he passed away.
                The doctors reportedly said that he suffered from a cardiac
                arrest.

                The Logical Indian Community pays tribute to Late Dr. Kalam with
                a heavy heart. Though he was known by many tags –‘People’s
                president’, ‘Missile Man’, ‘The man behind Vision 2020’; He will
                not only be remembered for the immeasurably remarkable
                achievements and marks he left behind, but surely as a Great
                Human, for his determined character, for his love, for his
                patriotism, for he could ignite our minds.

                Dr. Kalam was born in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu on October 15,
                1931, to a humble boat owner. A determined soul since childhood,
                he started working at an early age to contribute to the family
                income. He was brought up in a multi-religious, tolerant
                society; one with a progressive outlook. He overcame all odds
                and carried on to pursue graduation in physics and later study
                aerospace engineering on a scholarship.

                His first mark for our country was his accomplishments as a

                (DRDO) in 1960.

                He said he found himself when he started to work on the
                Satellite Launching Vehicle (SLV) project. Dr. Kalam made
                significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's
                first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
                successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth
                orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space
                Club. Dr. Kalam took up responsibilities for developing
                Indigenous Guided Missiles at the DRDO which led to the
                development of AGNI and PRITHVI missiles.

                11th President of India. After serving a term of 5 years, he
                returned to civilian life of education, writing and public
                service. He has written a number of books and documentaries, the
                best known being Wings of Fire and Ignited Mind. A recipient of

              achieve that goal as a united country. “A dream is not that which
              you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you
              sleep,” as he famously said.
